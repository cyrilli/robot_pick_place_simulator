# robot_pick_place_simulator
A Gazebo pick &amp; place simulation used to test and collect training data for deep learning based grasp detection algorithms

This simulation contains models from multiple resources:
1. [Baxter Simulator](https://github.com/RethinkRobotics/baxter_simulator) from Rethink Robotics
2. Test object models from [YCB dataset](http://www.ycbbenchmarks.com/object-models/)
3. Dropbox from Udacity [RoboND-Perception-Project](https://github.com/udacity/RoboND-Perception-Project)

Below are videos for testing a custom grasp detection algorithm in one-object and multiple-object scenarios.
